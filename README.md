# fedit
 A simple terminal-based text editor in C.

 It is based on [the kilo editor](https://github.com/antirez/kilo) by Salvatore Sanfilippo and [the tutorial series](https://viewsourcecode.org/snaptoken/kilo) by snaptoken.

 The Linux-specific code has been ported to Windows.

# Building
 The build is done by a single build script. On Windows, run `build.bat` in a Developer Command Prompt. On Linux, simply run `build.sh`.
