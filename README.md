# fedit
 A simple terminal-based text editor in C.

 **NOTE**: This project is WIP.

 The basic structure is based on [the kilo editor](https://github.com/antirez/kilo) by Salvatore Sanfilippo and [the tutorial series](https://viewsourcecode.org/snaptoken/kilo) by snaptoken; the memory management and the implementation of the data structures are inspired by Ryan Fleury's style.

 The Linux-specific code has been ported to Windows.

## Implementation notes
 This project was also a way to challenge myself to write a program without any use of malloc (or any other fancy allocators). All memory allocation is done through arenas and free-lists.

 It turns out that a text editor is not really a good candidate for this exercise, as it requires random access and contiguously stored data. List nodes can be allocated contiguously at first, but as the user edits the text this property is quickly lost.

 If you are implementing a text editor, I do not recommend to use this allocation scheme/data structure - unless you find a way to fix the complexity generated by the non-linearity of the data and the related inefficiencies.

## Building
 The build is done by a single build script. On Windows, run `build.bat` in a Developer Command Prompt. On Linux, simply run `build.sh`.
